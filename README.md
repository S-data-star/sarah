# 🚨 Fraud Detection Dashboard – Power BI Project

![Fraud Detection Dashboard](Fraud_detection.png.png)

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activity. Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard that summarizes key fraud statistics, trends, and insights — helping users identify patterns and high-risk areas.

## ✨ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw transaction data
- Analyze fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions
- Create insightful DAX measures and KPIs
- Build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard
- Identify high-risk merchant types and device types

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **DAX**: Custom calculations for fraud rates, statistical summaries, and dynamic measures

## ✅ Features

- 📊 **Transaction Summary**: Total transactions, fraud and non-fraud counts
- 🧮 **Statistical Summaries**: Mean, median, min, max of fraud transaction amounts
- 🔎 **Fraud Rate Calculations**: Overall fraud rate and average fraud rate
- 🗂️ **Fraud by Merchant Type & Device Type**: Identify categories with higher fraud risks
- 📈 **Distribution of Amounts**: Visualize transaction amount patterns
- 🌀 **Interactive Charts & Filters**: Drill-down analysis and cross-filtering

## 💡 Key Insights

- Fraudulent transactions represent only **5%** of total volume but usually involve **higher average amounts**.
- Certain merchant categories and device types have a **significantly higher fraud risk**, requiring targeted monitoring and preventive measures.
- Visual breakdowns help highlight areas to prioritize for fraud detection and policy improvements.
